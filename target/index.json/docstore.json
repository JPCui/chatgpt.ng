While the Intel Xeon W processors are rated at up to 205W TDP (thermal  design power), Mac Pro provides over 300W of processor cooling, allowing the  processor to maximize Turbo Boost performance during sustained workloads.  \nMac Pro | Technology Overview | March 2022 8 \n\nUp to 1.5TB of DDR4 ECC SDRAM  Mac Pro is offered with memory  configurations up to 768GB (6x128GB  or 12x64GB) on 8-, 12-, and 16-core  processors and up to 1.5TB (12x128GB)  on 24- and 28-core processors. These  configurations maximize the memory  bandwidth of the six-channel memory  controller. The processors are rated  by Intel to support up to 1TB or 2TB  respectively; however, configuring these  capacities would require populating  the system in an unbalanced DIMM  configuration. Populating Mac Pro with  six or twelve DIMMs of the same size,  type, and speed is recommended for  maximum performance.\n6K \nMemory \nA powerful multicore workstation processor needs plenty of high-bandwidth  memory to feed it. The Intel Xeon W in Mac Pro features a six-channel memory  architecture featuring 2933MHz DDR4 ECC memory delivering up to 140GB/s.  \nTwelve physical DIMM slots, two DIMMs per channel, located on the back  side of the main logic board (MLB) provide easy access and simple upgrades.  The 8-, 12-, and 16-core processors support up to 768GB of memory using  industry-standard DDR4 ECC DIMMs; the 24- and 28-core processors support  up to 1.5TB of memory using twelve 128GB LR-DIMMs. The 8-core Xeon runs  memory at 2666MHz (PC4-19200); all other processors operate at 2933MHz  (PC4-23466). \nMac Pro configurations start with 32GB of memory using four 8GB DIMMs,  therefore utilizing four memory channels. For maximum memory performance,  six or twelve DIMMs, fully utilizing each channel, should be configured. Mac Pro  supports both R-DIMMs (registered DIMMs) and LR-DIMMs (load-reduced  DIMMs), but R-DIMMs and LR-DIMMs cannot be installed in the system at the  same time; all DIMMs in the system must be of the same type.  \nThe 24- and 28-core processors support a massive 1.5TB of physical  memory that is enabled by 12 installed 128GB LR-DIMMs. This 128GB DIMM  utilizes 3D stacked DRAM to achieve high memory density. 3D stacked  memory increases memory latency by a small amount, slightly reducing overall  memory bandwidth by up to 10 percent. Applications that benefit from very  large amounts of memory typically benefit most significantly from the physical  capacity, eliminating the performance impact of using virtual memory\u2014with  even higher increases in memory latency due to swapping to disk. Applications  not needing that amount of physical memory are better served using lower capacity DIMMs without the increase in memory latency, and therefore higher  effective memory bandwidth.  \nPCI Express Expansion  \nMac Pro supports high-bandwidth internal expansion with eight PCI Express  gen 3 slots.

Today\u2019s modern GPUs  demand more power and more cooling: double-wide full-length cards with  massive thermal systems, multiple display outputs to drive 4K and higher  displays, and auxiliary (AUX) power connections to provide 300W or more  of power.  \nMac Pro was architected for multiple modular GPUs to enable configurability  and upgradability. But the typical industry-standard double-wide GPU card has  many challenges. First, the thermal systems, especially on-card fans, weren\u2019t  designed as part of the overall system thermal architecture. They are often loud  and not well-managed. In multi-GPU systems, the fans can actually compete  with each other for airflow, impacting performance. Second, the AUX power  requirements make GPU cards more complicated to install. Third, they don\u2019t  enable Thunderbolt, either on-card or in the system. So Thunderbolt isn\u2019t native  on the card (and if it were, it would steal from the GPU PCIe bandwidth), and  there is not a good solution to route DisplayPort video from the GPU into the  Thunderbolt controllers without additional cables and complexity.  \nApple set out to address these issues by designing a better solution for modular  GPU integration\u2014the Mac Pro Expansion Module, or MPX Module. The design  had four simple goals: enable maximum performance; enable Thunderbolt on  the GPU module; enable easy, cable-free installation; and enable backward  compatibility with industry-standard PCI Express cards.  \nFirst, the MPX Module design starts with the industry-standard GPU slot,  PCI Express x16, so it maintains compatibility with standard cards. \nSecond, the introduction of a secondary card-edge connector provides  additional independent PCIe bandwidth (x8 PCIe lanes) for Thunderbolt, routing  for DisplayPort video to the main logic board, control signals for management,  and a massive 475W of additional power on top of the 75W per PCIe x16 slot  already provided.  \nThird, it has a larger form factor. Bigger in x, y, and z dimensions, the quad-high  PCIe slot MPX Module provides space for a larger passive heat sink that can be  cooled efficiently as part of the larger thermal system in Mac Pro. This allows  Mac Pro to operate quietly even under heavy load. The larger size also enables  other solutions, such as dual GPU modules and RAID storage modules.  \nMac Pro | Technology Overview | March 2022 12 \nFinally, MPX Modules enable seamless Thunderbolt integration. Mac Pro  full-size MPX Modules have two independent Thunderbolt 3 controllers with  four Thunderbolt 3 ports on the card. The Thunderbolt controllers get their  PCIe bandwidth from the extra x8 PCIe lanes to the module, so are completely  independent from the graphics processor bandwidth. The full-size modules  also route DisplayPort connections to the main logic board to provide video  to the system\u2019s built-in Thunderbolt ports, which are enabled on a first-come,  first-served basis. The half-size modules provide two HDMI ports on the card  and route two DisplayPort connections to the main logic board to enable the  four built-in Thunderbolt 3 ports.  \nMac Pro has system support for two MPX bays, enabling two GPU modules in  the system for up to 1000W of graphics power.

The top bracket of Mac Pro provides  a mounting point for these solutions. The Promise Pegasus J2i is specifically  designed for this, connecting to the Mac Pro enclosure with a custom bracket  and cable to provide one or two 3.5-inch 7200-rpm SATA drives.  \nNote that while these accessories can be mounted internally in Mac Pro, from  a macOS security policy standpoint, they are treated like external drives. While  they can be encrypted with FileVault software in macOS, they are not encrypted  by the Apple T2 Security Chip.  \nApple T2 Security Chip \nMac Pro is architected with the security features and storage performance of  the Apple T2 Security Chip. The T2 chip integrates many discrete controllers  found in previous Mac systems like the System Management Controller (SMC),  audio, and SSD controllers. Its Secure Enclave coprocessor provides foundation  for the secure boot and encrypted storage features in Mac Pro. The T2 Security  Chip also provides a media engine including an HEVC hardware video encoder.  \nSecure Enclave. The Secure Enclave is a coprocessor fabricated in the  Apple T1, T2, and A-series processors. It uses encrypted memory and includes  a hardware random number generator. The Secure Enclave provides all  cryptographic operations for key management.  \nEncrypted storage. The data on the SSD in Mac Pro is encrypted using  dedicated hardware encryption in the T2 chip using keys tied uniquely to each  Mac Pro. This provides full disk encryption to all data stored on the SSD, with  line-rate performance from a dedicated AES crypto engine in T2 that only your  Mac Pro can read. FileVault on Mac Pro extends this encryption to add your  personal user key to ensure only your credentials can unlock your data.  \nSecure boot. Mac Pro supports a secure boot process. Starting with the  hardware root of trust in the T2 chip, each step of the startup process contains  components that are cryptographically signed by Apple to ensure integrity and  that proceed only after being cryptographically verified. This includes the boot  loaders, firmware, kernel, and kernel extensions. This secure boot chain helps  ensure that the lowest levels of software aren\u2019t tampered with and that only  operating system software trusted by Apple loads at startup.  \nMac Pro | Technology Overview | March 2022 19 \nInternal SSD  \nMac Pro is based on an SSD storage architecture and is configurable from  512GB up to 8TB of internal storage.

To create the  structure, a spherical array is machined  onto the internal and external surfaces of  the aluminum. The result is a lightweight  lattice pattern that maximizes airflow while  creating an extremely rigid structure. \nWheels  Optional wheels make Mac Pro easy to  move, whether from under your desk or  across the studio.\nEnclosure \nBuilding a workstation that delivers immense performance and modularity  meant considering it as an integrated system. High-performance processors,  memory, and graphics need to be enabled by an enclosure that provides the  power and cooling required for sustained performance as well as access for  modularity and upgradability.  \nThe starting point for Mac Pro: The stainless steel space frame accommodates  a vast range of components and configurations. The frame is strong, stands on  its own, and is ready to be built into a powerful system with endless possibilities.  Rounded handles on the top make Mac Pro comfortable to grab, and since  \nthey\u2019re directly connected to the space frame, they make the system solid and  stable when lifting or moving it. Feet on the bottom keep the system off the  floor, and optional wheels make it easy to move your Mac Pro, whether from  under your desk or across the studio.  \nA latch on the top of the tower enables the housing to slide off and provides  360\u00ba access to the entire system. Paired with a dual-sided logic board that  features a processor, graphics, and expansion on one side and storage and  memory on the other, everything is directly accessible. \nThe housing is constructed from aluminum and features a unique lattice  pattern that is machined from both sides with an offset to create an incredible  three-dimensional vent. Featuring front-to-back cooling, ideal for both tower  and rack design, the lattice pattern also makes the outer structure significantly  lighter while maintaining incredible strength. Much more than a decorative shell, the design enables a large two-dimensional open area for a high-airflow,  low-impedance design that allows the system to be cooled efficiently while  operating very quietly compared with competitive tower workstation systems.  \nMac Pro | Technology Overview | March 2022 21 \nTool-less Rack Rails  \nDesigned for rack workstation  applications, the rack-optimized  Mac Pro enclosure features tool-less  rails that support the most common  rack sizes and depths.

All ProRes codecs support  any frame size (including HD, 2K, 4K, 8K,  and larger) at full resolution. The data  rates vary based on codec type, image  content, frame size, and frame rate.  Apple ProRes RAW is based on the same  principles and underlying technology as  existing ProRes codecs, but is applied  to a camera sensor\u2019s pristine raw image  data rather than conventional image  pixels, ideal for High Dynamic Range  (HDR) content creation.  \nFor more information about ProRes  and ProRes RAW, see the Apple ProRes  White Paper and the Apple ProRes RAW  White Paper.\nAfterburner \nAfterburner is a PCI Express hardware accelerator expansion card designed  for Mac Pro that turbocharges post-production video workflows by offloading  ProRes and ProRes RAW video decoding.  \nMany film and video workflows rely on proxy workflows, where original camera native files are transcoded into lower-resolution proxy files, taking time,  compute resources, and additional storage space. Proxy files are then used for  editing, and then late in the workflow the files are matched back to the original  high-quality camera formats for color grading and finishing.  \nAfterburner was designed to enable camera native files to be used throughout  the workflow without the need for proxies. It does this by offloading the  decoding of all flavors of the ProRes video codec, including ProRes 422HQ,  ProRes 4444, ProRes XQ, and ProRes RAW, with the exception of interleaved  formats that are currently decoded strictly in software, and the final debayer  of ProRes RAW images that are done on the GPU.

With up to 28-core processing, 1.5TB of RAM, eight expansion  slots, up to four GPUs, and up to 12 Thunderbolt 3 ports, Mac Pro has  unprecedented configuration capabilities. Below are some considerations  for configuring and optimizing Mac Pro for your needs.  \nEnclosure Considerations  \nMac Pro is offered in both tower and rack configurations. While the main logic  board and internal modules are shared, each configuration utilizes a unique  enclosure, and therefore the form factor must be decided at time of order\u2014 the tower is not reconfigurable into a rack system.  \nThe tower enclosure comes standard with feet; wheels are a configurable  option. Both feet and wheels are available as a customer-installable kit and  therefore can be converted from feet to wheels or vice versa. \nThe Mac Pro tower enclosure can be physically secured using the Belkin Lock  Adapter for Mac Pro and an appropriate lock or cable lock system.  \nThe rack enclosure is a 5U system and includes stainless steel tool-less rack  rails that support both square-hole and threaded racks. Rack rails are included  with the rack enclosure but ship in a separate box from Mac Pro.  \nProcessor Considerations  \nMac Pro features Intel Xeon W processors from 8 to 28 cores. The base 8-core  processor delivers outstanding performance with a 3.5GHz clock speed, Turbo  Boost performance up to 4.0GHz, and support for up to 768GB of DDR4 ECC  memory at 2666MHz. The 8-core Mac Pro provides an alternative to the 8-core  iMac or iMac Pro, with a modular, upgradable enclosure that provides increased  graphics and display configurability and increased connectivity.  \nHigher-core-count Xeon processors deliver increased multithreaded  performance. While they have a decreased base clock (from 3.3GHz for the  12-core to 2.5GHz for the 28-core), the higher core count delivers greater  performance for applications that scale with cores. All Xeon W processors  above 8-core have a maximum Turbo Boost speed of 4.4GHz, reducing the  performance impact when running lightly threaded applications. It is important  to know if your primary applications can scale to higher core counts to get  maximum performance from top-end Xeon processors. Higher-core-count  systems will deliver greater performance when running multiple demanding  Mac Pro | Technology Overview | March 2022 32 \nStatus Indicator Light  \nThe status indicator light (SIL) on  the top of the tower enclosure,  front of the rack enclosure, or  back of both will blink amber if the  system encounters a memory error  on boot.

Radeon Pro W6800X and W6900X MPX  Modules support Infinity Fabric Link across two identical modules, and Radeon  Pro W6800X Duo MPX Modules support Infinity Fabric Link onboard across  the two W6800X GPUs on the module and across two W6800X Duo modules  when installed.  \nVideo applications that take advantage of Infinity Fabric Link\u2014such as  Final Cut Pro and Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve\u2014will benefit from the PCIe  bandwidth of the single W6800X or W6900X card for moving video data to and  from the system over PCIe and between the GPUs using Infinity Fabric Link.  The W6800X Duo module provides maximum GPU compute in Mac Pro,  providing up to four W6800X GPUs across two W6800X Duo modules, 60.4  teraflops of compute, and 128GB of GDDR6 memory across the four GPUs.  Applications optimized for multiple GPUs benefit most from this maximum  configuration, such as GPU-based rendering engines and machine learning.  \nThe Radeon Pro W5500 MPX Module provides strong graphics performance  and is a great solution for non-graphics-intensive applications. Like all MPX  graphics modules, it provides video support for built-in Thunderbolt 3 ports,  enabling Thunderbolt 3 display", "doc_id": "37c5a91b-9871-4a9a-9703-aa61e7b80643", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d65625326d7a0ddf713275cf179483075b3c9aefff31019744399ef9f5f68b84", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1TSnoXPwczFRroDtb6tBmKw-mbI4aLYpnG4qIhFWztpQ"}, "node_info": {"start": 80054, "end": 83646}, "relationships": {"1": "bbd4b7e4-5da5-4754-8c7c-777c5aafda9b", "2": "0df98f17-e68d-41ba-911d-0f9947af7fcc", "3": "50d3a73b-7781-4740-ba3a-505b8fb0b6a1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "50d3a73b-7781-4740-ba3a-505b8fb0b6a1": {"__data__": {"text": "or W6900X card for moving video data to and  from the system over PCIe and between the GPUs using Infinity Fabric Link.

Like all MPX  graphics modules, it provides video support for built-in Thunderbolt 3 ports,  enabling Thunderbolt 3 display connectivity to displays like Pro Display XDR  \nor LG UltraFine 5K. This module also enables six PCIe slots for maximum  expandability and is needed for applications like Avid Pro Tools when installing six HDX cards.  \nMac Pro supports many off-the-shelf AMD graphics cards. For a list of currently  supported GPUs, visit the Mac Pro Support page. Third-party GPUs typically  require AUX power. Mac Pro provides four 8-pin (150W each) AUX power  connectors that support the Belkin AUX Power Cable Kit. Note that at least  one Apple MPX Module is required to provide video support over Mac Pro  Thunderbolt 3 ports; without one, Thunderbolt 3 ports become data only and  are unable to light a display. AUX power ports are disabled (as well as not  physically accessible) when an MPX Module is installed in the corresponding  bay as that power is routed to the MPX connector.  \nMac Pro | Technology Overview | March 2022 34 \n\nTeradici CAS for macOS  \nWith Teradici CAS, Mac users can  access their high-performance  workflows\u2014including VFX, animation,  structural design, video editing, and  other high-performance creator and  design workflows\u2014from anywhere.  Using the Teradici PCoIP remote display  protocol to transfer only pixels,  corporate assets remain securely  located in industry-compliant, onsite  content networks. \nDisplay Considerations \nWith up to 12 Thunderbolt 3 ports across four GPUs, Mac Pro can support  up to twelve 4K displays, six 5K displays, or six Pro Display XDR displays.  Thunderbolt 3 can also support DisplayPort displays with the appropriate  cable or adapter, or be adapted to DVI, HDMI, and even VGA displays.  \nThunderbolt 3 optical cables enable distances up to 50 m.  \nExpansion Considerations  \nWith eight PCI Expansion slots, Mac Pro provides high-bandwidth internal  expansion for demanding I/O solutions such as Fibre Channel, SAS, RAID  engines, 40/50/100Gb Ethernet, NVMe SSD, SDI input and output, and audio  DSP processing cards.  \nIn a video editing configuration with two MPX graphics modules and the  Apple I/O card, three full-length PCIe card slots and 12 Thunderbolt 3 ports are  available for expansion\u2014room to support storage solutions like Fibre Channel,  Afterburner, and SDI I/O cards if needed.  \nAfterburner is a must-have option for any video editor working in a ProRes  workflow. When configured with Mac Pro, Afterburner comes preinstalled  in slot 5 to deliver maximum performance in that PCIe x16 slot. Also sold  separately as a kit, Afterburner can be installed in any available full-length PCIe  slot, but should be installed in the x16 slot for maximum performance (highest  stream count), especially when working in multistream 4K or 8K workflows.  \nMac Pro | Technology Overview | March 2022 35 \nExample Configurations  \nBelow are example Mac Pro configurations for several typical use cases.
